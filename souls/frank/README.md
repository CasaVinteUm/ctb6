# Forgetful Frank

> "Well, I'm the newest here. I thought I'd be helpful and volunteer at TABConf, but didn't expect to meet my fate here. 
> So, `I wanted to set some ground rules for the conference`, but, uh, things didn’t exactly go as planned obviously, 
> I heard voices and found this tree, and before you know it I made a deal with Grim and the tree captured me in a UTXO. 
> The good news is I left some rules around the conference that can free my soul, but I'm forgetting what my rules were. 
> I’m pretty sure the clues should all be in accessible areas."
